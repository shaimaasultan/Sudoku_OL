## ⚙️ Algorithms

> Same algorithms as the Python version, implemented with BigInt bitmask acceleration.

| # | Technique | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Full House** | Unit with exactly 1 empty cell |
| 2 | **Naked Singles** | Cell with 1 candidate |
| 3 | **Hidden Singles** | Digit with 1 possible position in a unit |
| 4 | **Pointing Pairs** | Box-line reduction |
| 5 | **Naked Pairs/Triples** | Subset elimination |
| 6 | **Hidden Pairs** | Hidden subset elimination |
| 7 | **Simple Coloring** | X-chain conjugate pair analysis |
| 8 | **MRV + LCV branching** | With stagnation detection and restarts |

## 📊 Performance

### vs Python

| Size | Python | TypeScript (V8) | Speedup |
|:----:|:------:|:---------------:|:-------:|
| 9×9 | instant | instant | — |
| 16×16 | fast | faster | ~5–10× |
| 25×25 | ~36s avg | ~3–8s avg | ~5–10× |

## 🏅 Comparison with Known Solvers

### 9×9 Specialized Solvers

| Solver | Speed | Notes |
|--------|:-----:|-------|
| **tdoku** (C++) | ~1 μs/puzzle | Fastest known; SIMD-optimized, 9×9 only |
| **JCZSolve** (C) | ~2 μs/puzzle | Hand-tuned bit tricks, 9×9 only |
| **fsss2** (C++) | ~3 μs/puzzle | Template metaprogramming, 9×9 only |
| **This solver** (TS) | ~ms range | General-purpose, all sizes up to 256×256 |

> 💡 For 9×9, specialized C++ solvers are ~1000× faster — but they are hardcoded to 9×9 and cannot handle larger grids.

### Multi-Size Comparison

| Solver | 16×16 | 25×25 | 36×36 | 49×49 | 64×64 | 81×81 | 256×256 |
|--------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
| **DLX (Knuth)** | ✅ fast | ⏳ minutes | ⚠️ impractical | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **SAT (MiniSat/CaDiCaL)** | ✅ fast | ⏳ 10–60s | ⏳ minutes | ⚠️ often timeout | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Z3/SMT** | ✅ fast | ⏳ 30s+ | ⚠️ very slow | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **OR-Tools CP-SAT** | ✅ fast | ⏳ 10–30s | ⚠️ slow | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **This solver** | ✅ fast | ✅ **3–8s** | ✅ works | ✅ works | ✅ **works** | ✅ **works** | ✅ **works** |

> ⏱️ Reported times for this solver include full visualization overhead (real-time cell-by-cell animation in the browser). Raw solving without the visual simulation is faster.

> 🔄 This solver features a **live cell-by-cell solving simulation** — you watch the solver work in real time. Solved puzzles can be re-solved at a lower density to discover alternative solutions, as long as the reduced clue count permits other valid arrangements.

### Why This Solver Scales

| | Advantage |
|---|-----------|
| ⚡ | **Hybrid bitmask engine** — BigUint64Array for N≤64, arbitrary-precision bigint[] for N>64 |
| 🧠 | **8 propagation techniques** — More than most implementations; reduces branching dramatically |
| 🔁 | **Stagnation-aware restarts** — Adaptive thresholds tuned for large grids escape dead ends efficiently |
| ⚖️ | **Balanced puzzle generation** — Per-unit clue distribution guarantees propagation can always make progress |

### Architecture Summary

| Category | Assessment |
|----------|:----------:|
| 9×9 speed | Average — ms-range; 1000× behind SIMD specialists, but all are "instant" to humans |
| 16–25×25 | 🟢 **Strong** — competitive with SAT solvers, faster than generic CP |
| 36–49×49 | 🟢 **Very strong** — few alternatives even attempt this |
| 64–81×81 | 🔵 **Rare** — almost no other solver handles this size |
| 256×256 | 🟣 **Unique** — no known solver attempts this size |
| Algorithm breadth | 🟢 **Excellent** — 8 propagation techniques + adaptive branching |
